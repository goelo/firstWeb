    slug: 'master-2048-tips-strategies',
    excerpt: 'Learn the best strategies to achieve high scores in 2048. From basic techniques to advanced tactics, this guide will help you reach the coveted 2048 tile and beyond.',
    content: `
      <p>2048 is a simple yet challenging puzzle game that has captivated millions of players worldwide. While the rules are easy to understand, mastering the game requires strategy and patience.</p>
      
      <h2>Basic Rules Recap</h2>
      <p>In 2048, you combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile, though you can continue playing to achieve even higher scores.</p>
      
      <h2>Essential Strategies</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Choose a Corner Strategy</h3>
      <p>Keep your highest tile in one corner (usually bottom-right) and build around it. This prevents your highest tile from getting trapped in the middle.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Focus on One Direction</h3>
      <p>Avoid using the up arrow key if you're keeping your highest tile in the bottom corner. This maintains your tile structure.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Build in Descending Order</h3>
      <p>Arrange tiles in descending order from your corner. For example: 1024, 512, 256, 128 in a row.</p>
      
      <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
      
      <h3>Snake Pattern</h3>
      <p>Create a snake-like pattern with your tiles, with the highest values following a path from your chosen corner.</p>
      
      <h3>Patience is Key</h3>
      <p>Don't rush moves. Think about how each move affects the entire board, not just the immediate combination.</p>
      
      <h3>Plan Ahead</h3>
      <p>Always consider where the next random tile will appear and how it might affect your strategy.</p>
      
      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Moving your highest tile away from its corner</li>
        <li>Creating gaps in your tile structure</li>
        <li>Making moves without considering consequences</li>
        <li>Panicking when the board fills up</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>With practice and these strategies, you'll be reaching 2048 and beyond in no time!</p>
